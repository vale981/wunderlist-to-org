* Wunderlist to Org Mode

A little script to convert the wunderlist export format to org mode.
It currently supports:

 - Todo states (~TODO~ and ~DONE~, starred becomes ~NEXT~)
 - Comments
 - Metadata
 - Reminders
 - Comments
 - File Attachments
 - Tags
 - Folders (become tags)

** Usage
Extract the wunderlist export and then just point the script to the ~Tasks.json~ file.
#+begin_src bash
  $ ./convert.py [task file]
#+end_src

This will print out the resulting org-mode file to the terminal.

The script is not configurable at the moments, but I can hack
something in if you open an issue.

** Internals
The script parses most things and skips things that it can't. So check
your resulting org file :).
